Workflow Scenario:
Scenario: "John’s Course Enrollment and Project Assignment"

Course Enrollment:

John comes to the office and provides his payment for course access.

Admin logs into the LMS, manually adds John’s details in the system (students table).

Admin assigns John to the “Advanced Web Development” course via the enrollments table.

John can now view all course content (including embedded YouTube videos and PDFs).

Quiz and Feedback:

Instructor uploads a quiz for the “Web Development” chapter.

John takes the quiz. The system automatically grades the quiz and stores the result in the quiz_results table.

John can view the feedback and grade for the quiz.

Project Management:

Admin creates a software project for a new client and sets the project budget.

Project Manager assigns tasks to employees for specific milestones.

Employees work on tasks, and progress is tracked. Each task's completion is updated, and employees' tasks are visible only to them.
